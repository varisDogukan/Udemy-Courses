## **`List, Add, Remove Todos`**

Create a Todo App that allows users to see, add, edit, and remove todos. It should contain the following components.

- **`App`** - this component should render the `TodoList` component
- **`TodoList`** - this component should render the `NewTodoForm` component and should render the list of Todo components. Place your state that contains all of the todos in this component.
- **`NewTodoForm`** - this component should render a form with one text input for the task to be created. When this form is submitted, a new `Todo` component should be created.
- **`Todo`** - this component should display a div with the task of the todo.
- For each Todo component, there should also be a button with the text “X” that when clicked, removes the todo.

## **`Editing`**

It’s time to edit some todos!

- Each `Todo` component should also display a button with the text “edit” that when clicked, displays a `form` with the task of the todo as an input and a button to submit the form. When the form is submitted, the task of the text should be updated and the form should be hidden.

## **`Further Study`**

- Alongside each `Todo`, add a button with the text “Mark as completed”. When this button is clicked, add a strike through the text of the todo.
- Instead of a button, refactor your application so that the todo itself can be clicked to mark it as completed. Add a strikethrough style to the `Todo` if it is completed. A user can toggle it on and off by clicking.
- Add some styling to your application! Try to use a CSS animation that fades out a `Todo` when it is deleted (this will involve adding/removing CSS classes).
- Save your todos in localStorage and retrieve them when the page loads.
