## **`Color Boxes`**

For this part, you should show a series of 16 boxes (a box is just square div with a background color).

Initially, each box should have a background color chosen from a random list of colors.

When you click any box:

it should change its color to a `different` random color.
Here’s some inspiration:

`Note:` Downward Data Flow?

For this exercise, you might need to violate the “children are dumber than their parents” rule of thumb, since each box will probably need to have its own color state, while the parent container doesn’t really need to be smart.

One of the further study points is to see if you can design the app to make the container smarter than the child boxes. This is quite advanced though, so be careful if you go down this path!
